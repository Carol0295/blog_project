# Debug Output

The code includes optional debug outputs that help trace the application's workflow during development.  
To enable these debug messages, set the corresponding debug constants in the code (in config.inc.php - `DEBUG`, `DEBUG_V`, `DEBUG_F` and `DEBUG_DB`) to `true`.  
These outputs are useful for understanding how data flows through the system, especially during login, post creation, and database operations.
